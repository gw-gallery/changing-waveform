# changing-waveform

The purpose of this demo is to illustrate how observed gravitational-wave signals depend on binary masses and distances, and thus how these quantities can be **measured** from gravitational-wave data.

The figure below (`reference_waveform.jpg`) shows an example gravitational waveform, corresponding to a $40+40\\,M_\odot$ binary at a luminosity distance of $D_L = 1\\,\mathrm{Gpc}$:

The overall amplitude of this signal is governed by both the luminosity distance and the _redshifted_ chirp mass, given by the combination $M_c(1+z)$:

$$
\mathcal{A} = \frac{[M_c(1+z)]^{5/3}}{D_L}
$$

The frequency derivative of the signal (aka the rate of the gravitational-wave "chirp") depends, in turn, on the redshift chirp mass.

$$
\dot f \propto [M_c(1+z)]^{5/3}
$$
